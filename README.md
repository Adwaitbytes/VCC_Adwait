## 🎮 Gameplay

> _“Get ready... Wait for it... CLICK NOW!”_

- Two players are matched in a virtual duel.
- A **“CLICK NOW”** signal appears after a **random delay** (1–4 seconds).
- The **first player** to click wins.
- If you click **too early**, you lose the round.
- No response from opponent? You still win — it’s part of the reflex game logic.

✅ Works even with just one player connected.  
🎯 Clean game loop — no awkward dead states.

## 💡 Why It Stands Out

- ⚡ **Instant Playability** — Works even when only one player reacts.
- 🤝 **Real-Time Multiplayer** — Fast syncing via WebSockets.
- 🧠 **Mind Game Vibe** — Makes players hesitate, overthink, and react.
- 🎨 **Neon UI & Terminal Aesthetic** — Styled for a modern cyber-duel feel.
